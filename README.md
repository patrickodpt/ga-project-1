# Simple Black Jack

## How to Play:

Black jack is a simple card game where the goal is to have a higher value hand then the dealer without exceeding the value 21. Both dealer and player are dealt two cards at the start of the game. The dealer keeps one card hidden while the player's turn is in progress. The player goes first and has two options: "hit" or "stand". If the player "hits", the player recieves another card. If the player "stands", the player's hand value is now set and the dealer proceeds to play. If either player's hand value exceeds 21, that player has "busted" and lost the hand. Lastly, and importantly, an Ace's value is either 11 or 1. If the player has exceeded 21, but has an Ace in hand, it's value will be converted to 11 to prevent a "bust".
